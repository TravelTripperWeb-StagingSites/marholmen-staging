During your stay here at the Marholmen Hotel you have a view of both the beach side, the docks and the archipelago building. Let your thoughts rest while the body is taken care of by a warm dry sauna or get full attention in one of our treatment rooms. Fresh air gives good appetite. The food is a big part of the experience here on the island and we want you to experience Marholmen with all the senses. We have Roslagens own food culture as a starting point, and our chefs cook all the food from scratch with seasonal local products. Come and enjoy a meal at the Sk&auml;rg&aring;rdsro restaurant or in the summer at our historic Caf&eacute; Grosshandlarg&aring;rden.</p>"
