  "description": "<p>Marholmen is an island in Roslagens archipelago only one hour's drive from Stockholm. This nature's oasis is ideal for conferences, parties and relaxing or family meetings. Our keys go to national romantic villas, hotel rooms with panoramic views and nice archipelago cottages.All houses and villas in Marholmen are unique in their way and have their charm. Commonly, they are of a high standard and that you are always close to the sea. Many of our cottages have their own sauna and/or wood burning stove and some even own beach with its own dock. Marholmens Spa Mareld is your place of retreat every day throughout the year. The food is a big part of the experience here on the island and we want you to experience Marholmen with all the senses. We have Roslagens own food culture as a starting point and our chefs cook all the food from scratch with seasonal local products. Come and enjoy a meal at the Sk&auml;rg&aring;rdsro restaurant or in the summer at our historic Caf&eacute; Grosshandlarg&aring;rden.</p>",
